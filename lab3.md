# CSE15L -- Anthony Chapov -- Lab 3 -- 1. Testing and Debugging 2. Researching command's variations. 

# Part 1:

## A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown):

### First input: 
Note that we inputp1 containts multiple copies of lowest value. We want to lowest value from the list, but what if there are few copies of same lowest value?
```

@Test
  public void testAvg4() {
    double[] input1 = {0.4,4.1,2.9,3.5,0.4}; //bug 
    assertEquals(3.5, ArrayExamples.averageWithoutLowest(input1),0.05);

  }
```

### Second input:
Note that here we have just 1 single element that is not copy of minimum value. So the average must consider just 4 because 2 and any of its copies must be excluded. Right?

```

@Test
  public void testAvg7() {
    double[] input1 = {2,2,2,2,2,4,2}; //including multiple copies of min el.
    assertEquals(4, ArrayExamples.averageWithoutLowest(input1),0.05);

}  
```

## An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
 
### First input:
Note: runs good because no duplicates. 

```
@Test
  public void testAvg5() {
    double[] input1 = {1,4.5,-2,3.4,0}; //including zero and negative value
    assertEquals(2.225, ArrayExamples.averageWithoutLowest(input1),0.05);
    
  }
```

### Second input:
Note: runs good because 2 is minimum value. Thus, any of its copies excluded from calculation. Excluding all 2's leaves us with {} list. In this case sum is not incremented and is still 0. Diving 0 by array's size (other than 0 of course) works correctly and produces 0. It is because for the calculation excluding minimum, we exclude all elements and thus take average of "nothing": zero as answer make sense. 

```
@Test
  public void testAvg6() {
    double[] input1 = {2,2,2}; 
    assertEquals(0, ArrayExamples.averageWithoutLowest(input1),0.05);
   //excluding minimum in this case is excluding all copies of 
   //minimum ->size < 2 -> 0 
  }
```
## The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)
![symptom](symptom.JPG)

## The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)

### Original code: 

```
static double averageWithoutLowest(double[] arr) {
  if(arr.length < 2) { return 0.0; }
  double lowest = arr[0];
  for(double num: arr) {
  if(num < lowest) { lowest = num; }
  }
  double sum = 0;
  for(double num: arr) {
  if(num != lowest) { sum += num; }
  }
  return sum / (arr.length - 1);
  } 
```

### Beatiful, magnificient, superb code (fixed):

```
static double averageWithoutLowest(double[] arr) {
    if(arr.length < 2) { return 0.0; }
    double lowest = arr[0];
    for(double num: arr) {
      if(num < lowest) { lowest = num; }
    }
    double sum = 0;
    int duplicatesOfMin = 0;

    for(double num: arr) {
      if(num != lowest) { sum += num; }
      else if (num == lowest) {duplicatesOfMin++; }
    }
    if (arr.length != duplicatesOfMin)
    return sum / (arr.length - duplicatesOfMin);
    else
    {
      return 0;
    }
  }

Time: 0.012

OK (13 tests)
```

## Briefly describe why the fix addresses the issue:
As we can see in the failure-producing input, whenever we have more than 1 copies of minimim value that we want to exclude, the original code assumes there is only 1 copy of minimum value and substracts just 1 from arr.length in the final sum/(arr.length - 1) calculation. We can see an example where 2,2,2,2,2,4,2 list must exclude all 2's and just leave us with 4. The wrong code correctly calculates the sum, since as long as num is not lowest it adds num. Basically it adds 4 because 4 is not equal to 2. It does not include 2's copies because 2 equals 2. BUT! As I stated above, it assumes that there is only 1 copy of 2, so it will exclude just 1 element when calculating the sum/ arr.length - 1 (mean). It is not what we want. We know that if we have multiple copies of 2, we want to exclude all of them from our calculation. So here is what I did. I count number of times 2 (lowest value) appears in the list, and substract amount of these copies when calculate the mean without lowest. So I get rid of number of 2's and then 4/1 = 4 is correct. Otherwise, it for arr.length-1 version, it calculates 4/size of array - 1 which is 4/6 = 0.67. 

Also I guarded the chance of having zero in the denamitor. I check if arr.length == duplicatesOfMin, so that we dont have situation X/0. 
If arr.length is equal to duplicatesOfMin, then its just case of something like {2,2,2}. It makes sense to set the avarage of this to zero because we exclude all two's from all calcuations as they all are our min value. So we get mean{} = 0.
