# CSE15L -- Anthony Chapov -- Lab 3 -- 1. Testing and Debugging 2. Researching command's variations. 


## A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown):

First input: 
```

@Test
  public void testAvg4() {
    double[] input1 = {0.4,4.1,2.9,3.5,0.4}; //bug 
    assertEquals(3.5, ArrayExamples.averageWithoutLowest(input1),0.05);

  }
```

Second input:
```

@Test
  public void testAvg7() {
    double[] input1 = {2,2,2,2,2,4,2}; //including multiple copies of min el.
    assertEquals(4, ArrayExamples.averageWithoutLowest(input1),0.05);

}  
```

## An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)

First input:
```
@Test
  public void testAvg5() {
    double[] input1 = {1,4.5,-2,3.4,0}; //including zero and negative value
    assertEquals(2.225, ArrayExamples.averageWithoutLowest(input1),0.05);
    
  }
```

Second input: 
```
@Test
  public void testAvg6() {
    double[] input1 = {2,2,2}; 
    assertEquals(0, ArrayExamples.averageWithoutLowest(input1),0.05);
   //excluding minimum in this case is excluding all copies of 
   //minimum ->size < 2 -> 0 
  }
```
