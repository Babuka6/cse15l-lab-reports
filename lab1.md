_Anthony Chapov, CSE15L, Lab Report #1 (cd, cat, ls use)_ 

## cd command block:

> **cd with no arguments**
  * a) ![cd with no arguments](res_cd_no_arg.jpg)
  * b) wd: /home/lecture1/messages
  * c)changes working directory to my home directory. /home 
  * d) It is not an error -- predefined behavior 

> **cd with files**
  * a) ![cd with file](cd_file_arg.jpg)
  * b)wd: /home/lecture1
  * c)bash: no such file or directory OR not a directory
  * d) cd does not work with files since it only works with directories. .txt and .java are files and terminal gives      error.

> **cd with directory**
  * a) ![cd with directory](cd_directory_arg.jpg)
  * ![cd with directory](cd_directory_arg_2.jpg)
  * b)wd: /home
  * c)terminal shows new working directory as long as path is correct. So say If I sit in /home and write cd lecture1 it will give new working directory /home/lecture1 because there is lecture1 in /home. But If I sit in /home/lecture1 and try to "cd home" -- it will give an error cause there is no "home" directory in /home/lecture1/ and I gave relative path. However, if I try to cd into /home from /home/lecture1/messages it will work because I provided absolute path. 
  * d)No errors in the first case. Second screenshot included just to show possible "error states" when path is !intentionally! incorrect.

## ls command block:

> **ls with no arguments**
  * a) ![ls with no arguments](ls_no_arg.jpg)
  
  * a2) ![ls with no arguments](ls_no_arg_two.jpg)
  * Remark: but it only list directories and files that 1 level below. So doing ls on home prints only lecture1 and not messages inside lecture1 cause its would be 
    level 2 while lecture1 is level 1 (where home is like level 0)
  * b)wd: /home/lecture1/messages
  * c)output is the text files in messages
  * d)no errors
  
> **ls with files**
 * a) ![ls with files](res_ls_files_arg.jpg)
 * b)wd: /home/lecture1/messages
 * c)Since the given path can be though of as having just the file, this command would simply list that path/file ("this file containts only this file")
 * d)No errors as long as accessed from correct working directory.
  
> **ls with directory**
 * a) ![ls with directory](ls_directory_arg.jpg)
 * 
 * b)wd: /home 
 * c)prints every folder and file in the specified path -- does not print folders and files that are sub folders of a folder/file in a current category 
 * d)no errors
---  
## cat command block:

> **cat with no arguments**
 * a) ![cat no argument](cat_no_arg.jpg)
 * b)wd: /home
 * c) Creates a infinite loop of taking input from keyboard or some other string value? 
 * d) Technically not at en error but bugs the terminal. To cancel the input and fix terminal I found solution on google â€” press ctrl + d
  
> **cat with files**
 * a) ![cat with file](cat_files_arg.jpg)
 * b)wd: home/lecture1/messages
 * c) Okay so cat works with files because it prints the information from files and also dont need the whole path. Cause it works with files and folders it cannot 
     print stuff from messages
     cause messages contaitns files it is not a file
 * d) No error
  
> **cat with directory**
 * a) ![cat with directory](cat_directory_arg.jpg)
 * b)wd: home/lecture1/messages
 * c) Does not work with messages or anything that is not a file like .txt 
 * d) No such file or directory. Probably the "no such file" is the only relevant part of the error since it works only with files?
